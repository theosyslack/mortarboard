          <p>Which of the young men does she like the best? Parting tracked by arriving…perpetual payment of the perpetual loan, Growing among black folks as among white, They have cleared the beams away…they tenderly lift me forth. Landscapes projected masculine full-sized and golden.</p>

          <p>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair, Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me, It was tied in your mouth…in mine it begins to be loosened. Lithographing Kronos and Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson, Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!.</p>

          <p>The machinist rolls up his sleeves…the policeman travels his beat…the gate-keeper marks who pass, You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle. If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing or next to nothing, I have heard what the talkers were talking…the talk of the beginning and the end, The nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or the motion of waves a key.</p>
          <p>Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols, The carnival of sleighs, the clinking and shouted jokes and pelts of snowballs; The woollypates hoe in the sugarfield, the overseer views them from his saddle; The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with me, A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me.</p>

          <p>What have I to do with lamentation? A few light kisses…a few embraces…a reaching around of arms, Where the life-car is drawn on the slipnoose…where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand, The smoke of my own breath, At home in the fleet of iceboats, sailing with the rest and tacking.</p>

          <p>The captain on the quarter deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet, Long enough have you dreamed contemptible dreams, Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems? And in due time you shall repay the same service to me; They desire he should like them and touch them and speak to them and stay with them.</p>
            
          <p>Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns, Parting tracked by arriving…perpetual payment of the perpetual loan, A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming. The farmer stops by the bars of a Sunday and looks at the oats and rye, All these I feel or am..</p>

          <p>And any thing I have I bestow. And the tree-toad is a chef-d'ouvre for the highest, There was never any more inception than there is now, This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is, We have not struck, he composedly cried, We have just begun our part of the fighting.</p>

          <p>And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes, and the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known. (Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you,) Picking out here one that shall be my amie, Why should I wish to see God better than this day?</p>

          <p>The nine months' gone is in the parturition chamber, her faintness and pains are advancing; And I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer's girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking shortcake. Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession…rapt and austere in the woods, a gymnosophist, I reach to the leafy lips…I reach to the polished breasts of melons. Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you.</p>

          <p>Many sweating and ploughing and thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving, Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols, silently rising, freshly exuding, I celebrate myself, I anchor my ship for a little while only, Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking.</p>

          <p>Accepting the gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine, Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you; The slow-march played at night at the head of the association, A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deerskin leggings, These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me.</p>
